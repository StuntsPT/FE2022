# Trabalho final de Fundamentos de Epidemiologia

For this assignment you will have to present a report. Below you will find the necessary instructions.


## Choose a disease - any disease. ("General introduction")

* Search the literature for studies on a specific disease
* Describe it in the report (what it is, who it affects, symptoms, known treatments, etc...)
* Report your own work's objectives to finish off this section


## Find epidemiological studies on this disease (This sort of works like a "Methodology" section)

* One paper for at least 4 of the 5 types of study we approached
* Make sure the studies are at least somewhat comparable (Eg. don't try to compare a cohort study performed in Peru, with a Case-Control study performed in Germany
 * The Randomized Control Trial **can** be an exception to this rule
* Briefly present each paper, like a *micro*, or even *nano* abstract


## Briefly describe each of the selected studies, focus on the methodology (This will be the "Results" section)

* Compare the different studies' results
* Try to replicate the performed analyses
 * If you can't perform the same type of analyses, replace them with an adequate alternative
* Compare the original results with your own
 * Explain any methodological differences
* Include any code you use as an "Appendix" (alternatively bundle your R scripts with the report) 


## Finish with a results discussion

* How compatible are the results from multiple studies?
* Were they possible to replicate?
 * Are your results compatible with the original studies'?
* How are these studies connected?
* Finish with your opinion on the matter
